# hypixel-stock-tracker

This is a project that I worked on with a student while tutoring a Java class. 
Based on his interest in Skyblock Hypixel, we used their API to determine the amount of in game currency you could get for the output of each type of minion on different levels.

We only covered the Farming type minions, but the project could be expanded to include any other type of minion by following the same format.
